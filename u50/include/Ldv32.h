/*------------- Device Information -----------------------------------------*/

/*
 * LDVDeviceCaps (32-bit) contains constants describing the capabilities of a
 * LonWorks Interface device.  These constants can be OR-ed together where
 * LonWorks Interface devices support multiple capabilities (e.g. an i.LON-100
 * Interface will specify LDV_DEVCAP_L5 | LDV_DEVCAP_PA; a USB Interface will
 * specify LDV_DEVCAP_L2 | LDV_DEVCAP_L5 | LDV_DEVCAP_SWITCHABLE | LDV_DEVCAP_PA).
 *
 * LDV_DEVCAP_L5            The device can operate as a layer 5 network interface.
 * LDV_DEVCAP_L2            The device can operate as a layer 2 network interface.
 *                          (This typically also means that the device could operate
 *                          as a protocol analyzer, but this assumption should not be relied upon.
 *                          There may be legitimate reasons why a layer 2 device has
 *                          been configured to operate only as a layer 2 network interface).
 * LDV_DEVCAP_LWIP          The device can operate as a LonWorks/IP device (channel).
 *                          Note that these type of devices cannot be opened using OpenLDV;
 *                          they can only be opened with LNS.
 * LDV_DEVCAP_PA            The device can operate as a protocol analyzer interface.
 * LDV_DEVCAP_XDRIVER       The device is an xDriver-based device and so is (typically)
 *                          physically located remotely from the host PC.
 *                          This is more of an informative flag than a capability,
 *                          but it still might be useful to know and be able to filter
 *                          based on this information (especially when considering that
 *                          remote network interfaces may have possibly undesirable side-effects
 *                          such as latency and response time issues, and connection costs;
 *                          and with device aliasing it might not otherwise be possible to tell).
 * LDV_DEVCAP_SICB          The device supports/generates SICB  formatted packets.
 * LDV_DEVCAP_LDVEX         The device supports/generates LdvEx formatted packets.
 * LDV_DEVCAP_NOSTATUS      The device does not support niSSTATUS.
 * LDV_DEVCAP_SWITCHABLE    The device can be switched to operate as either a layer 5
 *                          or a layer 2 network interface using this API.
 * LDV_DEVCAP_ATTACHABLE    The device is capable of being attached/detached from the
 *                          host PC.  It is possible to receive attachment/detachment
 *                          notifications for this device by registering a Window handle
 *                          using the ldv_register_window function.
 * LDV_DEVCAP_CURRENTLY_L5  The device is currently operating as a layer 5 network interface.
 * LDV_DEVCAP_CURRENTLY_L2  The device is currently operating as a layer 2 network interface.
 * LDV_DEVCAP_CURRENTLY_ATTACHED
 *                          The device is currently attached to the host PC.
 *                          This applies to devices that can be physically removed
 *                          (whilst their device entries remain, assuming that the driver
 *                          disconnect doesn't remove all driver entries).
 *                          This includes USBLTAs, and could also possibly be extended
 *                          to include xDriver RNIs that have become disconnected
 *                          (whether or not xDriver Recovery is in effect).
 *                          The opposite of this state implies that the device
 *                          is currently detached from the host PC.
 * LDV_DEVCAP_CURRENTLY_AVAILABLE
 *                          The device is currently not in use by any process on
 *                          this machine.  If it is not is use by another machine
 *                          then this indicates that the device is available for use.
